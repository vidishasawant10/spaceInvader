# spaceInvader
Space Invaders is a game in which the player moves and shoot a bullet cannon horizontally across the bottom of the screen and fires at aliens overhead. The
aliens begin that move left and right as a group, shifting downward each timethey reach a screen edge. The goal is to eliminate all of the aliens and not let the
aliens touch the bottom of the screen by shooting them. It is the most common game played by everyone. So as a mini project I created Space Invader using <b> Pygame library in Python.</b>
